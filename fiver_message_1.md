Hi there,

I'm working on a research project called "Don't Publish, Don't Perish," and I could use your help.

The project looks at how economists, unlike most other PhD students, often finish their degrees without any peer-reviewed publications.

We want to gather some data to dig deeper into this. The work is fun and not hard at all.

In the following (and next mesasges) it might seem like there is lots of details, but its just to make it more structured and easier for you.

I've got three CSV files with the names of economics professors from Dalhousie University, the University of Calgary, and McGill University.

Here's what I need you to do:

For the three departments of economics (Dalhousie, Calgary, McGill), I already created thre CSVs with the name and rank of the professors from the 3 respective URLS:

Dalhousie_Economics_Faculty.csv from https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/economics/faculty-staff/our-faculty.html
Calgary_Economics_Faculty.csv   from https://arts.ucalgary.ca/economics/contact/economics-directory/full-time-faculty
McGill_Economics_Faculty.csv    from https://www.mcgill.ca/economics/people

Professors: Look up the professors listed in the CSV files

Gather Information: From their profiles, find out where they got their highest degree (like a PhD) and the year they got it. Download their CVs from their profiles and make sure to rename the document following the convention "first-last_cv".

Fill Out the Data: Check their CVs to see how many peer-reviewed publications they had by the time they finished their PhD (most economists have zero). Note the year of their first publication after getting their PhD. Count their total number of peer-reviewed publications.

Use These Examples: Check out the Academic_Scholar_Codebook.csv for all the details you need to collect. Look at the dpdp_ubc_economomics.csv for a full example of what the data should look like. In the csv dpdp_ubc_economics, you will see how I collected the data.
