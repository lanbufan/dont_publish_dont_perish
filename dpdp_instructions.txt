For my research project "Don't Publish, Don't Perish," here's a clear, programmatic approach to guide the research assistant (RA) through the data collection process:

Step-by-Step Data Collection Guide for RAs

Understanding the Objective:

The project aims to study publication patterns of economics PhD graduates compared to other disciplines, focusing on the absence of peer-reviewed publications at the time of graduation.

Initial Setup:

Ensure you have access to the provided CSV files containing preliminary data of scholars from Dalhousie University, the University of Calgary, and McGill University.

Familiarize yourself with the codebook which defines the variables and data to be collected.

Accessing Department Websites:

Navigate to the economics department's web pages

https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/economics/faculty-staff/our-faculty.html
https://arts.ucalgary.ca/economics/contact/economics-directory/full-time-faculty
https://www.mcgill.ca/economics/people

Use the CSV files to find specific professors listed. These files include names and, in some cases, academic ranks.

Dalhousie_Economics_Faculty.csv 
Calgary_Economics_Faculty.csv   
McGill_Economics_Faculty.csv    

Data Collection from Individual Profiles:

For each professor, click through to their personal or professional page to collect further information:

Highest Degree and Institution: Identify the institution from which they received their highest degree (e.g., PhD from Harvard).

Year of Degree: Record the year they obtained their highest degree.

For a complete list of informations to collect, please see Academic_Scholar_Codebook.csv

for a full examples of collected data, see dpdp_ubc_economomics.csv

CV Download and Analysis:

Download the CV of each scholar, typically available on their profile.

Refer to a similar folder structure as provided in the UBC example for organizing downloaded CVs (UBC_ECON).

Filling Out the Data Sheet:

Using the scholars’ CVs and online websites (sometimes you have to click a few links), complete the CSV file according to the following details:

Peer-reviewed Publications at PhD Completion: Note the number of publications at the time of obtaining their PhD (often zero for economists).

First Publication Post-PhD: Calculate the years after PhD completion until the first peer-reviewed publication.

Total Career Publications: Count the total number of peer-reviewed publications over their career.

For a full list of the variables to collect, see Academic_Scholar_Codebook.csv

Reference and Verification:

Use the example CSV from UBC as a model to ensure consistency in how data is recorded and formatted.
Double-check each entry for accuracy against the CV and the department’s website.

Documentation and Notes:

Maintain notes on any anomalies or unique findings during data collection in the 'Notes' section of the CSV.

Regular Updates and Sync:

If you have any questions during the data collection, do not hesitate to contact me.

Regularly update the lead researcher on your progress and clarify any doubts regarding the data collection process or interpretations.

This structured guide should help ensure that the data collected is accurate and comprehensive, adhering closely to the research project's goals and methodology.
