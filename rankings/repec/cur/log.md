# HYPOTHESIS

## association between high status PhD and publication

rank=50
Near Significance: The p-value of 0.056 suggests that there is a near-significant association between attending a high-status school and having publications at graduation. While it doesn't meet the conventional threshold of 0.05, it indicates a trend that might be worth further investigation.
Observed vs Expected: The observed frequencies for high-status schools (e.g., 45 economists with 0 publications, 16 with 1 publication) are somewhat different from the expected frequencies (e.g., 41.63 with 0 publications, 15.61 with 1 publication).

rank=30
Interpretation
Chi-Square Value: The chi-square value of 12.994 indicates a noticeable difference between the observed and expected frequencies.
P-value: The p-value of 0.023 is less than the conventional threshold of 0.05, indicating that the results are statistically significant. This suggests there is a significant association between the status of the PhD school and the likelihood of having publications at graduation.
Degrees of Freedom: This is the number of independent values or quantities which can be assigned to a statistical distribution, which in this case is 5.
Expected Frequencies: These are the frequencies we would expect if there were no association between school status and publication count.
Conclusion
Statistical Significance: The p-value of 0.023 indicates that there is a statistically significant difference in publication counts between economists from high-status and lower-status schools.
Publication Likelihood: The contingency table shows that a larger proportion of economists from high-status schools (43 out of 57) have zero publications by graduation compared to those from lower-status schools (37 out of 66). This suggests that economists from high-status schools are less likely to have publications by the time they graduate compared to those from lower-status schools.
Hypothesis Confirmation
The hypothesis that economists trained in high-status schools are more likely to have at least one publication by graduation year is not supported by the data. Instead, the data suggests that economists from high-status PhD programs are less likely to have publications by the time they graduate.

## association between high status PhD and more than 1 pub

Two-Proportion Z-Test:

Z-statistic: -1.8348539884128174
P-value: 0.06652732670098302
Interpretation:
Z-Statistic:

The Z-statistic is approximately -1.835. This negative value indicates that the proportion of economists with more than one publication in the high-status group is lower than that in the low-status group.
P-Value:

The P-value is approximately 0.067. This value is higher than the conventional significance level of 0.05 but less than 0.10.
A P-value of 0.067 means there is a 6.7% probability that the observed difference in proportions is due to random chance alone.
Significance:

At a significance level of 0.05, the result is not statistically significant because the P-value (0.067) is greater than 0.05.
However, if we consider a significance level of 0.10, the result is marginally significant, suggesting that there might be a weak evidence of difference.

##logistic 1: only high-status 50

Interpretation
Intercept (const):

The intercept of -0.1823 is not significantly different from zero (p-value = 0.426). This term represents the log-odds of having 0 publications for an economist from a low-status school.
High_Status_School:

The coefficient for High_Status_School is 0.7701, which is significantly different from zero (p-value = 0.023). This positive coefficient indicates that attending a high-status school increases the log-odds of having 0 publications by PhD graduation year.
In terms of odds ratio, exp(0.7701) â‰ˆ 2.16, suggesting that economists from high-status schools are about 2.16 times more likely to have 0 publications by graduation compared to those from low-status schools.
Model Significance:

The likelihood ratio test p-value (0.02156) indicates that the model with High_Status_School as a predictor is significantly better than the null model with only an intercept. This suggests that the status of the PhD-granting institution is a significant predictor of having 0 publications by graduation.
Pseudo R-squared:

The pseudo R-squared value of 0.02606 is relatively low, which is typical for logistic regression models. It indicates that the model explains a small portion of the variance in the dependent variable.
Conclusion
The results suggest that economists who graduated from high-status schools are significantly more likely to have 0 publications by the time they graduate compared to those from low-status schools. This finding is statistically significant at the 5% level.
